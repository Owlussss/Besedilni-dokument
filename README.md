## Lessons Learned From Teaching Artificial Intelligence to Middle School Students
The AI4GA project is developing a nine-week elective course titled Living and Working with Artificial Intelligence, which is being piloted in several middle schools across Georgia. Our goal is to introduce AI education to all students, so the course is designed to accommodate a diverse range of student abilities, academic backgrounds, and prior experience with computing. It also allows teachers the flexibility to adapt the material to better suit their students' needs and interests. The course primarily focuses on unplugged activities and online demonstration programs, with optional small programming projects using AI tools for teachers to incorporate into their lessons. In this poster, we share insights and lessons learned from the initial pilot offerings, conducted by five teachers who taught 12 sections of the course, reaching a total of 299 students. The results demonstrate that middle school students can successfully engage with and understand complex technical concepts related to Artificial Intelligence.


## Robots at Schools
Robots have entered the educational system and are now being utilized to achieve a variety of educational goals, such as supporting computational thinking and enhancing peer interaction. In this paper, we present three examples of how robots are being used in schools based on practices from European projects.

The first example explores the use of telerobotics, where robots are employed to facilitate interaction at a distance, particularly when students are unable to attend classes in person. Telerobots enable students to participate in classroom activities remotely, overcoming geographical and physical barriers to learning.

The second example focuses on the development of educational pathways using robots to promote inclusion. Through carefully designed robotic activities, schools can ensure that all students, regardless of their abilities, can actively participate and benefit from the learning process.

Finally, we examine how robotics is being used to introduce young learners to Embodied Artificial Intelligence. By interacting with robots, students gain hands-on experience with AI concepts, helping them understand how technology can mimic human behaviors and processes.

These examples demonstrate that robots are a versatile and effective tool in education, leveraging their embodiment to engage students in ways that traditional teaching methods might not.
## How educators perceive Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our everyday lives. Recognizing the growing importance of AI, educators are not only expected to teach students about AI but also to incorporate AI tools into their teaching practices, ensuring that students are adequately prepared for an AI-driven world. Therefore, it is essential to understand educators' views on AI. This study investigates how educators perceive AI, whether they teach it, the challenges they encounter when teaching AI, the kind of support they may need for future AI instruction, and potential differences between Cypriot and international educators. The research involved two online surveys with 197 educators, followed by interviews with 10 Cypriot educators, to gain insights into their perceptions of AI. The results revealed a common understanding of AI as “human-like” machines capable of learning and problem-solving using data. However, there were significant differences in the definitions of AI between Cypriot educators and their international peers. The study also highlighted that while educators recognize the importance of teaching AI, they lack formal training and specialized tools for teaching AI, emphasizing the need for focused interventions and resources tailored to their specific requirements.
## Application of Hybrid Image Processing Based on Artificial Intelligence in Interactive English Teaching
Primary school English teaching resources play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of English education. In the information age, it is essential for primary school English teaching to incorporate multimedia resources and gradually diversify the content to meet modern educational needs. Augmented reality (AR) innovation, a form of mixed image processing technology, is one of the key technologies expected to significantly impact primary education in the next five years. AR can seamlessly integrate virtual objects into the real environment, making it an effective tool for information gathering and absorption. It also encourages student engagement, fosters creativity and imagination, and strengthens collaboration between students and teachers. Additionally, AR creates diverse learning environments, offering vast potential for educational development.

Primary school English resources based on augmented reality transform learning experiences from two-dimensional presentations to immersive three-dimensional displays, enriching the way English content is taught. This technology can spark students' interest in learning English and support a shift towards more interactive and innovative teaching methods. The use of AR in education is a valuable experiment with promising outcomes. This paper presents the results of an experiment comparing an experimental class with a control class. Most of the scores in the experimental group ranged from 71 to 100, with 27 students (67.5%) falling into this range. In contrast, the control class scores were more evenly distributed, with the highest number of students scoring between 61-70, totaling 10 students (25%). These findings highlight the significant role of augmented reality in promoting interactive and effective English teaching.
## The Paradigm Shifts in Artificial Intelligence
In 2023, Artificial Intelligence (AI) gained global attention with the rise of pre-trained models like GPT, which powers conversational AI systems such as ChatGPT. These models allow for human-like interactions on a variety of topics, marking a significant shift in AI's role. Unlike previous AI models that were trained for specific tasks, these pre-trained models can now be used for diverse applications such as general conversations, decision-making, and content generation (e.g., documents, code, video) without being explicitly trained for these tasks. This evolution positions AI as a versatile, general-purpose technology rather than a tool for specific functions. The scientific history of AI provides important context for understanding its potential, limitations, and the challenges that still lie ahead.
