# Using Artificial Intelligence in Schools

## Introduction

Designers often face complex, nonlinear problems, and a key goal of design education is to foster students' problem-solving abilities. This is referred to as *Design Thinking* in design education [1]. Creativity plays a crucial role in this process, as it involves generating and realizing innovative ideas and optimal problem-solving strategies. Thus, design education emphasizes nurturing creativity to enhance problem-solving skills.

With societal and industrial transformations, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied across various sectors, including education. Since 2016, the Ministry of Education in China has introduced policies to promote AI in education, highlighting its role in driving educational reform. Similarly, countries such as the United States, France, Japan, and Singapore have developed AI strategies, recognizing it as a transformative force in education.

The integration of AI in education is pivotal, requiring countries to redefine the skills needed by teachers to adapt to changes in teaching brought by AI. AI's interdisciplinary nature and its dynamic evolution necessitate ongoing adaptation to integrate professional expertise with AI applications.

Tapalova et al. categorized educational applications of AI into five scenarios, encompassing technologies like adaptive learning, personalized learning, and academic analytics. These innovations provide personalized learning experiences, enhance school management, and optimize online learning environments.

For example:
- Kong et al. reviewed AI applications in art education, identifying challenges and opportunities.
- Hwang et al. explored AI's role in mathematics education and its research trends.
- During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI technologies proved essential for online teaching and enriching primary education learning experiences.

Teachers, as leaders of educational reform, play a critical role in adopting and using these technologies. According to the Theory of Reasoned Action, people's behavior is largely influenced by their intentions, which stem from attitudes and social norms. This theory is fundamental to understanding technological acceptance in education.
