# Using artificial intelligence in schools

## Introduction

Designers often face complex and nonlinear problems, and one of the purposes of design education is to cultivate students’ problemsolving ability. This ability is known as ”Design Thinking” in design education [1]. Design is closely related to creativity because creativity involves generation and realization of new ideas and optimal problem-solving strategies. Designers must possess corresponding creative abilities to solve specific problems. Therefore, design education places a strong emphasis on students’ creativity and
further cultivate their problem-solving skills. With the transformation of societal industrial structures, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has been applied across various sectors, and the field of education has become one of the important scenarios for the application of artificial intelligence technology. 
Since 2016, the Ministry of Education in China has successively issued series of policies related to AI education, emphasizing the importance of AI in driving educational reform. Similarly, countries like the United States, France, Japan, and Singapore have formulated AI development strategies, recognizing AI as a pivotal force for educational transformation. The integration of Artificial Intelligence is both crucial and advantageous in education. Countries need to clarify the skills that teachers must have in the new era in order to adapt to the changes in education and teaching brought about by artificial intelligence technology [2].
